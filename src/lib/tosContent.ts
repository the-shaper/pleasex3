By creating an account or using the Please Please Please platform (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

Please Please Please is currently offered as a **Beta / Proof of Concept** service.

- The Service may contain bugs, errors, interruptions, or other issues that could result in data loss or unexpected behavior.
- The Service is provided **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,”** without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.
- We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, feature stability, or long-term availability.

Use of the Service during the Beta phase is at your own risk.

## **3. Platform Role**

Please Please Please is a **platform and intermediary**, not a party to agreements or interactions between users.

- Creators are solely responsible for fulfilling or declining requests.
- Friends are solely responsible for the content and legality of their submissions.
- The Platform does not guarantee outcomes, responses, or successful fulfillment of any request.

---

## **4. Definitions**

## **5. Terms for Friends (Buyers / Requesters)**

### **5.1 Submission Rules**

Friends agree to submit only lawful, respectful, and non-abusive requests. Requests involving harassment, illegal activities, spam, or coercion are strictly prohibited.

### **5.2 Priority Ticket Payment Flow**

If a Creator enables Priority Tickets:

- **Authorization:** Submitting a Priority Ticket places a temporary authorization hold on your payment method via Stripe. This is not a charge.
- **Capture:** Your payment is captured only if and when the Creator explicitly marks the Ticket as “Approved.”
- **Release:** If the Ticket is rejected or remains unapproved for approximately seven (7) days, the authorization hold is released automatically.
- **Bank Fees:** The Platform is not responsible for overdraft fees or bank charges related to authorization holds.

### **5.3 No Guarantee of Service**

Submitting a Ticket—including a Priority Ticket—does not guarantee acceptance, fulfillment, or response. Creators retain full discretion over which requests they approve or reject.

### **5.4 Refunds**

- Once a Ticket is approved and payment is captured, refunds are generally at the discretion of the Creator.
- The Platform reserves the right, but does not assume an obligation, to intervene in exceptional circumstances, including abuse, fraud, or platform misuse.

## **6. Terms for Creators (Sellers)**

### **6.1 Stripe Connect Requirement**

Creators must maintain a valid Stripe Connect account to receive payouts. The Platform is not responsible for failed payouts caused by incorrect, incomplete, or restricted Stripe accounts.

### **6.2 Fulfillment Responsibility**

By approving a Ticket, a Creator agrees to make a **good-faith effort** to fulfill the request as reasonably understood at the time of approval.

- Repeated failure to fulfill approved (and charged) Tickets may result in account suspension or termination.

### **6.3 Platform Fees**

The Platform retains a **[X]% fee** on Priority Tickets. Fees are deducted automatically when funds are captured.

### **6.4 Taxes**

Creators are solely responsible for determining, reporting, and paying any applicable taxes arising from their earnings.

---

## **7. The Queue Algorithm**

- The Queue is managed by an automated system designed to surface Priority and Personal Tickets at an **approximate 3:1 ratio**.
- The Platform does not guarantee exact ordering, timing, or visibility.
- Users agree not to manipulate, spam, or attempt to reverse-engineer the Queue or platform mechanisms.

---

## **8. User-Generated Content (UGC) & Intellectual Property**

### **8.1 Tickets (Requests)**

Friends retain ownership of the text and media submitted in their Tickets but grant the Platform and the selected Creator a limited, non-exclusive license to host, process, and display the content for the purpose of operating the Service.

### **8.2 Deliverables**

Unless explicitly agreed otherwise between users:

- Creators retain copyright in any work they produce.
- Friends receive a **perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use the deliverable for personal and commercial purposes.
- Creators may reuse, display, or adapt their work, provided such use does not disclose private or personal information from the original request.

## **9. Code of Conduct & Account Security**

- Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their Clerk login credentials.
- Harassment, abuse, threats, or discriminatory behavior are not tolerated.
- The Platform reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts, with or without notice, where we reasonably believe behavior violates these Terms or harms other users or the Service.

System updates, maintenance, or resets may result in partial or total data loss.

---

## **12. Changes to These Terms**

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

---

## **13. Governing Law & Jurisdiction**

These Terms are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of that jurisdiction.
