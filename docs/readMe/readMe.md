### QUEUES

The queues are where the tickets are stored. There are two queues: the PERSONAL queue and the PRIORITY queue.

#### PERSONAL

People can ask you favors for free or for any tip under the amount you set for the Priority queue.

#### PRIORITY

People can ask you favors for any tip above the amount you set for this queue.

#### 3:1 HIERARCHY

By default, there is a 3:1 hierarchy in how tasks are executed. Per every 3 Priority tickets served, 1 Personal ticket is served.

Why? Because it's a way to motivate users and creators to use the Priority queue. The more you get done, the more you earn.

What if you want to change the hierarchy? For now, you can only turn off the Priority queue. 
If this feature is requested enough times, we will add it.

#### EARNINGS

You can start monetizing your time by connecting your Stripe account. If you don't have one, we highly recommend you create one. It won't just be useful for this app, but for transacting as an independent creator via the internet in general.

This is not a shill for Stripe nor are we compensated in any way. Eventually we will add more blockchain payment methods.


##### COMMISSIONS

We take a $3 per every $50 you make, and your payouts are scheduled at the end of every month.

**Important:** Stripe charges separate fees per transaction and the specific amount is dependent on the account's region. 

#### A PROOF OF CONCEPT

This is a proof of concept and we are looking for feedback. Please please please let us know if you have any issues or suggestions drop us a line to create@twilightfringe.com with the subject 'PPP' or click 'here'
