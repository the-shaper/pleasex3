# Twilight Design System:

# Power Pop! Theme

These are the main UI components and patterns used for **Please Please Please!**  
It’s an evolving system: the goal is to refine it through real usage, and expand it for future projects.  

The intent is to make something that **feels like a toy, but works like a tool**—a playful interface layered on top of workflow-serious functionality.

This system will continue to grow as product needs surface. Rather than forcing a rigid style upfront, the UI itself will “tell” us what it wants to become through production pressure, feedback, and iteration.

## What's Inside

This system is optimized for **form, fun, and function**.  
Every component exists to solve specific workflow needs within the ticketing model:  

- reviewing submissions  
- tracking queues  
- managing approvals  
- presenting earnings  

At this stage, the priority is unifying visual language and interaction patterns across the product rather than pursuing pixel-perfect standardization.

## Component Structure

The design system is organized into several major categories:

- **Dashboard Components** – navigation, approval panels, task modules, and financial reporting  
- **Checkout & Forms** – ticket approval cards, Stripe flows, donation UI  
- **General Components** – buttons, tags, modals, reusable primitives  
- **Swagger (Visual & FX)** – WebGL/Three.js animated background elements


### Dashboard Components

Components used in the creator dashboard for managing queues, approvals, and tasks:

- **Sidebar** - Navigation component with sections and links
- **Approval Panel** - Interface for reviewing and approving ticket submissions
- **Task Module** - Display and interaction for individual tasks
- **Table Components** - Data tables for queue management
- **Earnings Panel** - Financial overview and Stripe integration

### Checkout & Forms

Components for ticket submission and payment processing:

- **Checkout Donation** - Tip input and priority queue selection
- **Ticket Approval Cards** - Display and approval interface for tickets
- **Payment Wrappers** - Stripe integration components

### General Components

Reusable UI primitives and utilities:

- **Button Base** - Foundation button component
- **Tag Base** - Tag/badge component for labels
- **Modals** - Various modal dialogs (About, Legal, Privacy, etc.)

### Swagger (Visual & FX)

- **Hands Background** - Animated background component with WebGL shader effects

## Getting Started

Browse the component categories in the sidebar to explore available components. Each component includes:

- **Stories** - Interactive examples showing different states and variations
- **Autodocs** - Automatically generated documentation with props and usage
- **Controls** - Interactive controls to test component behavior
- **Accessibility** - A11y testing results and guidelines

## Component Organization

Components follow a hierarchical naming structure:

- `Components/[Category]/[Subcategory]/[ComponentName]`

For example:

- `Components/Dashboard/Sidebar/SideBar`
- `Components/General/ButtonBase`
- `Components/Checkout/TicketApprovalCard`

## Development Guidelines

- All components use TypeScript
- Components follow React best practices with proper prop types
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- Components are designed to be reusable and composable
- Most components include comprehensive Storybook stories
